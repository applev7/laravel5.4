# Chart example using Charts Package

It's always good fit for understand if we use some graphical way display our progress report using chart. So if you are working with laravel 5 framework then you can use chart very simple way and best layout. There are several js library available for chart like chartjs, highcharts, google, material, chartist, fusioncharts, morris, plottablejs etc.

In this example we will just use one laravel "ConsoleTVs/Charts" composer package and you can use all the chart library.

Using above library you can simply create following Charts.

1. line chart
2. area chart
3. bar chart
4. pie chart
5. donut chart
6. geo chart
7. gauge chart
8. temp chart
9. percentage chart
10. progressbar chart
11. areaspline chart
12. scatter chart

Using ConsoleTVs/Charts package we can simply create above lists on chart.

# JQuery Skills Free

We don't require to write jquery code for chart because we can manage it from controller method.

So here i give you very easy example of bar chart using highcharts library,
in this example i display bar chart of new user registration on current year month, that way we can identify which month comes more new users registration.

# Install Package

first of all we will install ConsoleTVs/Charts composer package by following composer command in your laravel 5 application.

    composer require consoletvs/charts

After successfully install package, open config/app.php file and add service provider and alias.

config/app.php
```
'providers' => [

	....

	ConsoleTVs\Charts\ChartsServiceProvider::class,

],
```
```
'aliases' => [

	....

	'Charts' => ConsoleTVs\Charts\Facades\Charts::class,

]
```

#Add Users Dummy Records:

you have users table by running default migrations of laravel. So we have to generate dummy records for demo in users table. So let's run bellow command and get dummy records.

#Artisan Tinker

This is most poopular and beautiul feature of Artisan, which you can run any line o code just like you did in your controller or model.

```
php artisan tinker
>>> factory(App\User::class, 20)->create();
```

Now we will add routes, so simply add following route in your route file:

Let's start by adding these routes to our admin route group:

    Route::get('chart/users', 'ChartController@index');

Here,we require to create new controller ChartController that will manage index method of route. So let's put bellow code.

run this code

    php artisan make:controller Admin/ChartController

Add following code into index method

```
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers\Admin;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use Charts;
use App\User;
use DB;

class ChartController extends Controller
{
    /**

     * Show the application dashboard.

     *

     * @return \Illuminate\Http\Response

     */

    public function index()

    {
        $users = User::where(DB::raw("(DATE_FORMAT(created_at,'%Y'))"),date('Y'))

            ->get();

        $chart = Charts::database($users, 'bar', 'highcharts')

            ->title("Monthly new Register Users")

            ->elementLabel("Total Users")

            ->dimensions(1000, 500)

            ->responsive(false)

            ->groupByMonth(date('Y'), true);

        return view('backend.chart',compact('chart'));

    }
}
```

#Add chart.blade.php File:

At last we require to create blade file call chart.blade.php, will bootstrap layout. So let's add bellow code:

resources/views/backend/chart.blade.php

```
@extends('master')
@section('title', 'User Registration Report')
@section('content')

    {!! Charts::assets() !!}
    <div class="container">

        <h1>Laravel 5 Chart example using Charts Package</h1>

        {!! $chart->render() !!}

    </div>

@endsection
```

Now, finally we are ready to run this example. So you can run and test our chart.
